What do we want to communicate?
===============================

Address - numbers, #
phone - numbers, -()
web - :/?&=#
twitter - @
email - @.
math - +-%,.  [recipes,finance]
money - numbers, $,.%
boolean - !

Adding these 26 characters gives us lots more freedom in communicating
without changing the 52-card ciphers. Separating encoding from encryption
lets us do this seamlessly.
